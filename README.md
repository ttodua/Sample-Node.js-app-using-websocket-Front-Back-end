**Recommendation: you do not need to use AJAX at all, and we suggest you totally remove it and migrate into using Websockets, as it can replace probably all scenarios that AJAX is used for (but with events). Try to board on WS and you will not look back to AJAX.

App is made with:
- Front-End: Vue 3 & Bootstrap 5 & jquery;
- Back-End: express & ejs;
